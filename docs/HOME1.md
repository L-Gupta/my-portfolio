Home (Landing) Page — UI/UX Design Specification
Purpose of This Page

The Home page is the entry point to the site and is designed to make an immediate first impression in under 5 seconds. Its primary goal is clarity over cleverness: clearly establish who I am, what I do, and where the visitor should go next.

This page is intentionally minimal, with strong typography and generous whitespace. It is not meant to overwhelm the user with content, but to act as a calm, confident introduction.

Overall Layout Concept

The page uses a two-column hero layout:

Left column: Identity, message, and primary actions

Right column: Personal visual (photo or graphic) that humanizes the site

The layout should feel balanced, modern, and editorial rather than “tech-dashboard-like.”

Top Navigation Bar
Elements

Left: Name / personal brand

Text: Lakshya Gupta

Acts as a “home” reset when clicked

Right: Minimal navigation links

Home

Certifications

Contact

(Placeholder: future navigation items may be added, e.g., Journey / Experience)

Design Intent

Clean, unobtrusive

No heavy background or divider unless needed for contrast

Navigation should not dominate visual hierarchy

📌 Placeholder decision:

Whether navigation should be sticky or static on scroll

Hero Section (Primary Focus)
Left Column — Text Content
Main Heading

A large, bold, 1–2 line introduction statement.

Example intent:

A concise statement that communicates identity and direction
(not a biography, not buzzwords)

📌 Placeholder:

Final headline copy (tone: confident, technical, human)

Supporting Links

Below the headline are two primary outbound actions:

Resume link

LinkedIn link

Design notes:

These should look like secondary CTAs

Text links or subtle buttons (not loud)

Clear affordance without visual clutter

📌 Placeholder:

Resume hosting location (PDF vs external link)

Exact LinkedIn URL

Right Column — Visual Identity

This space is reserved for a personal image or visual representation.

Current placeholder:

“A cool pic of mine goes here”

Design intent:

Humanize the page

Add personality without being casual

Avoid stock-photo energy

Possible directions:

Professional portrait

Stylized photo

Minimal illustration / graphic representation

📌 Placeholder decisions:

Image type (photo vs illustration)

Image shape (rectangular, card, soft corner, floating)

Whether the name watermark (“LAKSHYA GUPTA”) stays or is removed

Highlight / Callout Section (Below Hero)

This section is a single horizontal band spanning the width of the page.

Purpose:

Surface one interesting, differentiating idea

Can be rotated over time

Acts as a soft hook to encourage scrolling

Example intent:

A philosophy

A current focus

A short “thinking-style” statement

📌 Placeholder:

Final content (text length: 1 short sentence)

Whether this is static or rotatable content

Background color treatment (highlight vs neutral)

Visual & Interaction Principles

Typography-first design

High contrast, readable text

Subtle motion only (fade-in, slight slide)

No heavy animations on initial load

Whitespace is intentional and should be preserved

What This Page Is NOT

Not a resume replacement

Not a project gallery

Not a technical deep-dive

Those live elsewhere.

This page exists to say:

“You’re in the right place. Here’s who I am.”

Open Questions for UI/UX

📌 These are intentionally left unresolved:

Final headline copy

Image style and treatment

Highlight section content

Exact spacing scale for hero text

Whether the page should feel more editorial or more technical

Success Criteria

This page is successful if:

A visitor understands who I am in < 5 seconds

The page feels calm, confident, and intentional

The user knows where to click next without being told
