About Me Section — Design & Interaction Specification
Purpose of This Section

The About Me section provides context after the Home page introduction. While the Home page establishes who I am at a glance, this section answers:

“Who is this person, and how do they think and work?”

This section is not meant to be a long biography. It should feel structured, scannable, and intentional, balancing personality with credibility.

Overall Layout Concept

The section is divided into two vertical layers:

Top layer: Personal introduction (image + narrative)

Bottom layer: Structured details (Skills, Education, Certificates)

The top layer humanizes; the bottom layer organizes.

Top Layer: Personal Introduction
Left Column — Personal Image

Reserved space for one personal image

Acts as a visual anchor for the section

Image should feel consistent with the Home page (same tone, not necessarily same photo)

📌 Placeholder decisions:

Final image selection (portrait vs casual)

Image treatment (square vs rounded, bordered vs floating)

Whether the name watermark (“LAKSHYA GUPTA”) is retained

Right Column — Narrative Text

5–6 lines of text

Short paragraphs, not a wall of text

Tone: reflective, technical, grounded

The content should communicate:

Academic background

Technical interests

How I approach learning and problem-solving

📌 Placeholder:

Final text copy

Line breaks and emphasis (bold / highlight words)

Bottom Layer: Interactive Information Panels

This layer contains three clickable categories:

Skills

Education

Certificates

These are not separate pages. They act as toggleable content panels within the About section.

Interaction Model (Critical)
Category Buttons

Skills, Education, and Certificates are interactive selectors

Only one category is expanded at a time

Clicking a category:

Highlights it

Displays its content

Collapses the other two

📌 Placeholder:

Interaction style (tabs vs buttons vs underline selector)

Animation style (fade, slide, expand)

Skills Panel
Content Intent

Communicate breadth and structure

Avoid overwhelming lists

Skills may be grouped (example):

Languages

Frameworks

Tools

Concepts

📌 Placeholder:

Skill grouping logic

Ordering (by proficiency vs relevance)

Visual representation (list, chips, columns)

Education Panel
Content Structure

Institution name (UW–Madison)

Degree(s)

Major(s)

GPA

Optional: Relevant coursework

This panel should feel:

Clean

Credible

Academically grounded

📌 Placeholder:

Exact formatting of GPA and majors

Whether coursework is shown or hidden by default

Layout hierarchy (degree vs institution emphasis)

Certificates Panel
Content Intent

Supplement credibility

Not overpower Education or Skills

Certificates should be:

Listed clearly

Possibly collapsible or scrollable if long

Secondary in visual weight

📌 Placeholder:

Certificate list source

Whether links or verification icons are shown

Sorting (chronological vs relevance)

Visual & Interaction Principles

Maintain visual consistency with Home page

Generous whitespace

Clear typography hierarchy

Subtle animation only on interaction

Content-first, decoration-second

What This Section Is NOT

Not a resume dump

Not a timeline

Not a project showcase

It exists to add depth, not replace other sections.

Open Design Questions

📌 Items intentionally left open:

Final copy for narrative text

Visual style of category selectors

Skill grouping structure

Certificate display depth

Mobile behavior for toggle panels

Success Criteria

This section is successful if:

A reader understands my background in under 30 seconds

Information is easy to scan

Interaction feels intentional, not gimmicky

The section complements, rather than repeats, the Journey and Experience pages
